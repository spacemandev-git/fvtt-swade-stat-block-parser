Lord of the City of Brass, ruler of the
Kingdom of Dunscon, Alistair Dunscon is
the Federation of Magic’s presumptive and
virtually undisputed leader. That is to say,
many dispute what the Federation is—in
terms of land and population—but few
deny Dunscon’s rule of it all.
In his own mind, all of the Magic Zone
must bow to his authority, and ultimately,
the world will be his to rule once he is done.
His father, Nostrous Dunscon, founded
the original Federation, which at one
time promised to be a grand alliance of
magical powers across the North American
continent. Unfortunately, the elder
Dunscon’s megalomania, delusions, and
ruthlessness led to fractures in an already
strained alliance; when the Coalition States
came to do battle, he stood without the help
of such kingdoms as Tolkeen and the City of
Dweomer, and he and his family were slain.
Only his young son, Alistair, survived.
After years of travel, first as a fugitive
through the Magic Zone, and then long
journeys through the Rifts, out among the
Megaverse®, an eternally youthful Alistair
Dunscon returned to the region, claimed his
birthright as the rightful ruler of the True
Federation of Magic, and began building
his kingdom. Far more than ruthless and
power-hungry, Alistair embraces evil and
rage for all they are worth. He wants to
rule, certainly, yet he also craves painful,
devastating vengeance against all who
abandoned his father, as well as those who
directly or indirectly had a hand in the
destruction of his family.
To this end, he draws the most hate-filled
and vengeful survivors of the destruction
of Tolkeen to him; he welcomes the most
vile practitioners of the darkest of magics;
he takes council with greater demons, devil
lords, and diabolical supernatural beings—
he is even said to be in league with the
horrid Splugorth who control Atlantis. In
short, Lord Alistair Dunscon is an evil man
who seeks to rule a kingdom on the bones
and blood of his enemies. Frighteningly, he
may have the power to succeed.
The Skin of the Demon scale mail armor
Dunscon wears is crafted from the body
of a living demon (no longer sentient, but
still technically alive). Daemonfist is his staff
crafted from jade, carved in the form of two
intertwined snakes, and the Bands of Denial
protect him from enemy evocations.

Special Abilities:
Bind the Summoned: A Shifter can
bind summoned beings to their service
for an extended period of time. He does
this by reducing his maximum PPE by
the amount needed when using summon
ally. The creature remains bound to his
service until released or Incapacitated.
At Legendary Rank, he may retain up to
five summoned allies. Bound allies have
the Resilient ability. When using Magic
Rituals, ignore 4 points of penalties for
Improved Duration.
Communication Rift: By concentrating
for a full round Shifters can open microRifts across space and dimensions,
just large enough to send and receive
spoken messages; costs 15 PPE near a
ley line, or 50 PPE away from one.
Dimension Sense: With a Spellcasting
check, determine the following about a
dimension: environmental conditions,
magic poor or rich, temporal shifts,
whether it is a parallel dimension, etc.
Dimensional Teleport Home: Once
per day for 25 PPE, a Shifter can teleport
himself home regardless of distance.
Expanded Awareness: Shifters detect
arcana as an Innate Ability. With a
Notice roll, they sense supernatural
beings or dimensional manipulations.
Immortality: Transformed by his
travels through the Megaverse®,
Dunscon is immortal and immune to
most Hazards as well as all possession.
Ley Line Phasing and Ley Line Gate:
See The Tomorrow Legion Player’s Guide.
Ley Line Magic Mastery: See The
Tomorrow Legion Player’s Guide.
Psychotically Brave: A Legendary
Shifter, Dunscon gains +5 to Fear checks
and subtracts 5 from Fear Table results.
Regeneration: Dunscon’s immortality
also confers rapid healing—make a
Vigor check every hour to heal wounds.
Sense Rifts: Shifters can sense
dimensional anomalies within 50 miles
(direction, type, general location), or
anywhere along a ley line’s length.
Shift Reality: Shifters get a free reroll
(can't reroll Critical Failures) on all
Spellcasting rolls related to: banish, boost/
lower Trait, drain Power Points, illusion,
intangibility, invisibility, light/darkness,
sloth/speed, sound/silence, summon
ally, teleport, and +4 to open, close, or
manipulate Dimensional Portals.
Weakness (Sacrifices): The price for
Alistair Dunscon's immortality is the
sacrificial death of a sentient being once
a week, from whom he must drain the
life essence at the moment of death.
