Throughout the Midwest and middle
portions of Canada, there are dozens
(perhaps hundreds) of tribes of human
mutants called Psi-Stalkers. Intimately
comfortable in the wild and naturally psionic,
they would typically be just another race on
the Coalition’s hit list of things to eradicate.
However, early encounters happened to
be with officers of greater cunning and
foresight. So instead, many Psi-Stalkers
found themselves with an opportunity to
pursue their favorite activities—hunting
and slaying supernatural monsters and
wielders of magic—while gaining respect,
support, and even pay for doing it.
Like the Dog Boys, Psi-Stalkers have
gained great prominence and a measure
of acceptance among front-line CS troops.
Their natural gifts in finding and fighting
supernatural threats, combined with
fearlessness and general expertise in the
great wilds most humans avoid, make them
exceptionally valuable assets. Unfortunately,
their mutant status and generally spooky
appearance (pasty white skin, hairless, a
tendency to file their teeth into points,
prominent tattoos and piercings) make them
less than desirable among the Coalition
population at large.
This suits most of them just fine, as they’d
rather be out in the wilderness, hunting,
fighting…and feeding. Psi-Stalkers require
very little food or water to survive, sustained
instead on ISP and PPE energy. Perhaps the
greatest reason they were so readily recruited
and incorporated into Coalition military and
security service, Psi-Stalkers are effectively
psychic vampires. Their Psychic Vampire
ability enables them to shut down wielders
of magic and psionics, which is a handy
tactic in any fight against magical forces.
For all their feral, apex predator
appearance and nature, Psi-Stalkers enjoy
an incredible empathy and affinity with
most animals. They’re naturally good
riders, and most animals treat a Psi-Stalker
as one of their own.

Special Abilities:
@Animal Empathy:
Psi-Stalkers have
an inherent empathy
with animals. Animals treat them
as one of their own. This effect can
be problematic if the animal in
question is a territorial loner.
@Fast: Psi-Stalkers have Pace +2
and increase their Running die
by one die type (usually a Pace
8 and d8 run die).
@Psychic Sense: Psi-Stalkers
have the inherent ability
to detect arcana, as a sense.
They use the Notice skill
to detect the presence and
location of any psychic or
magic energies, beings,
or items. They can also
use Survival (tracking) to track a
specific magical or psionic entity.
This sense works to detect anything
psychic, magic, or supernatural,
including invisible and astral beings.
Psychic Sense doesn’t work inside
sealed armor or vehicles.
@Psychic Vampire: Psi-Stalkers require
a diet of PPE or ISP directly drained
from a living being. They gain this
using the Draining PPE/ISP Setting
Rule in The Tomorrow Legion Player’s
Guide, which only works by touch.
The Psi-Stalker must cut and draw
blood from an intended victim or
donor, which must be supernaturally,
magically, or psionically active to
provide sustenance. Psi-Stalkers must
consume at least 5 Power Points (PPE
or ISP) a day or suffer a Fatigue level.
They starve to death after a week of
being Incapacitated by lack of “food.”
Each 5 PPE/ISP drained restores one
level of Fatigue. Consumed Power
Points cannot be used to fuel spells
or psionic powers.
@Racial Enemy: Many Psi-Stalker
and Simvan tribes have been
at war for years and will
generally attack each other
on sight!
